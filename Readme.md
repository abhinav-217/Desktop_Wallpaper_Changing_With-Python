This is a basic level Project or you can say a demonstration to show that how you can change your desktop wallpaper with python very easily..

I know that this is a very raw project But obviously in the future I am going to make it a GUI so that everybody can use it with just a .exe python file....... just like any other desktop apps.......

I hope You liked it.
